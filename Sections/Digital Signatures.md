## Digital Signatures


#### Use (in order):

1. [Ed25519](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EdDSA): very popular, accessible, fast, uses small keys, produces small signatures, deterministic, and offers ~128-bit security.

2. [Ed448](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EdDSA#Ed448): less popular and slower than Ed25519 but uses SHAKE256 (a SHA3 variant) instead of SHA512 for hashing and edwards448 instead of edwards25519 for the curve, meaning a 224-bit security level.

#### Avoid (not in order because they’re all bad):

1. [Plain RSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)#Attacks_against_plain_RSA), [RSA-PKCS#1 v1.5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)#Padding_schemes), and [RSA-PSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probabilistic_signature_scheme): plain RSA is [insecure](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/20085/which-attacks-are-possible-against-raw-textbook-rsa), RSA-PKCS#1 v1.5 has [no security proof](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probabilistic_signature_scheme) and is [no longer recommended in the RFC](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8017#section-8), and RSA-PSS is slow for signing and generating keys, produces larger signatures, and requires larger keys than [ECC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic-curve_cryptography) based signing algorithms. Moreover, RSA has [implementation traps](https://crypto.stanford.edu/~dabo/papers/RSA-survey.pdf).

2. [ElGamal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ElGamal_signature_scheme): old, even slower than RSA, not included in cryptographic libraries, basically not used in any software, not standardised, produces large signatures, and if the message is used directly rather than hashed, as specified in the [original paper](https://caislab.kaist.ac.kr/lecture/2010/spring/cs548/basic/B02.pdf), then that allows for [existential forgery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ElGamal_signature_scheme#Security).

3. [DSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Signature_Algorithm): very old, becoming less and less supported, typically used with an [insecure key size](https://buttondown.email/cryptography-dispatches/archive/cryptography-dispatches-dsa-is-past-its-prime/), slower than Ed25519, requires larger keys than [ECC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic-curve_cryptography), and it's not deterministic, which has led to [serious vulnerabilities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_Curve_Digital_Signature_Algorithm#Security) (please see below).

4. [ECDSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_Curve_Digital_Signature_Algorithm): slower than Ed25519 and not deterministic, which has led to [serious vulnerabilities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_Curve_Digital_Signature_Algorithm#Security) that affected Sony’s PS3 and Bitcoin, allowing attackers to recover private keys. This issue can be prevented by properly generating a random nonce, which requires having a good [CSPRNG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographically-secure_pseudorandom_number_generator), or by deriving the nonce deterministically using [something like HMAC](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6979#section-3). However, there’s been a shift to Ed25519 because it prevents this issue from happening as well as being better in other respects. Furthermore, there’s also the concern mentioned in the [Key Exchange/Hybrid Encryption](#key-exchangehybrid-encryption) Avoid section that the NIST curves use [unexplained seeds](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8031#section-4), which is [not a good look](https://safecurves.cr.yp.to/rigid.html) considering that [Dual_EC_DRBG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_EC_DRBG) was a NIST standard despite containing an [NSA backdoor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_EC_DRBG#Weakness:_a_potential_backdoor).

5. [Post-quantum algorithms](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/post-quantum-cryptography): these are still being researched, aren’t implemented in mainstream libraries, are much slower, and typically have very large key sizes. However, it will eventually make sense to switch to one in the future.

#### Notes:

1. Please read points 1, 2, 9, and 10 of the [Key Exchange/Hybrid Encryption](#key-exchangehybrid-encryption) Notes section because all these points about key pairs/private keys apply for signature algorithms as well.

2. Use authenticated hybrid encryption (an authenticated key exchange with authenticated encryption) instead of encryption with signatures: this is easier to get right and more efficient.

3. Use Sign-then-Encrypt **if you must use signatures with encryption** to provide sender authentication: Encrypt-then-Sign can allow an attacker to strip off the original signature and replace it with their own. For symmetric encryption, Sign-then-Encrypt-then-MAC, which involves signing the message, appending the signature to the message, and using either Encrypt-then-MAC or an AEAD, prevents this problem. Similarly, if you’re forced to use asymmetric encryption, then you can still use Sign-then-Encrypt but should include the [recipient’s name or the sender and recipient's names in the message](https://theworld.com/~dtd/sign_encrypt/sign_encrypt7.html) because the recipient needs proof that the same person signed and encrypted the message. Once the signature and encryption layers are bound together, an attacker can't remove and replace the outer layer because the reference in the inner layer will reveal the tampering. Alternatively, you can Encrypt-then-Sign-then-Encrypt or Sign-then-Encrypt-then-Sign, which are both slower.

4. **Don’t** use the same key pair for signatures (e.g. Ed25519) and key exchange (e.g. X25519): it’s [recommended](https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium/issues/632#issuecomment-345272065) to **never use the same key for more than one thing** in cryptography. **The security of using the same key pair for these two algorithms has not been (sufficiently) studied**, signing key pairs and encryption key pairs often have different life cycles, and using different key pairs limits the damage done if one key pair is compromised. Since the keys are so small, using different key pairs produces barely any overhead as well. The only time you should really convert an Ed25519 key pair to an X25519 key pair is if you’re [heavily resource constrained](https://monocypher.org/manual/advanced/from_eddsa) or when you’re forced to use Ed25519 keys (e.g. SSH public keys off GitHub could be used for hybrid encryption).

5. Prehash large messages: signing a message normally requires loading the entire message into memory, but this can be problematic for very large (e.g. 1+ GiB) messages. To solve this problem, you can use [Ed25519ph](https://doc.libsodium.org/public-key_cryptography/public-key_signatures#multi-part-messages) or Ed448ph (which probably isn't available) to perform the prehashing for you with some additional domain separation, or you can prehash the message yourself using a strong, modern hash function, like BLAKE2b or SHA3, with a 512-bit output length and sign the hash instead of the message. However, note that not prehashing means that Ed25519 is [resistant to collisions in the hash function](https://ed25519.cr.yp.to/eddsa-20150704.pdf). Therefore, when possible, ordinary signing should arguably be preferred for additional protection, although this isn't realistically a problem if you use a secure hash function.

6. Be aware of [fault attacks](https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/1014.pdf) against deterministic signatures: techniques like causing [voltage glitches](https://cybermashup.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/practical-fault-attack-against-eddsa_fdtc-2017.pdf) on a chip (e.g. on an Arduino) can be used to recover either the entire secret key or part of the secret key, depending on the signature algorithm, and create valid signatures with algorithms like Ed25519, Ed448, and deterministic ECDSA. However, this is primarily a concern on embedded devices and requires [physical or remote access](https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/1014.pdf) to a device. Four [countermeasures](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/50228/can-deterministic-ecdsa-be-protected-against-fault-attacks?rq=1) include signing the same data twice and comparing the outputs, which is obviously slower than signing once, verifying the signature after signing, which is [slower](https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/1014.pdf) than signing twice for small messages but [faster](https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/1014.pdf) for large messages, [calculating a checksum over input values](https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/1014.pdf) before and after signature generation, or using a cryptographic library that implements the algorithm with some random data in the calculation of the nonce, which is the technique used by [Signal](https://signal.org/docs/specifications/xeddsa/#security-considerations). However, these countermeasures are [not guaranteed to be effective](https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/985.pdf), and there can be other [side-channel attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side-channel_attack) as well.
